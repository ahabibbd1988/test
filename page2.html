<br>Why and what kind of personal data we collect
<br>Observations
<br>To help detect spam, we collect details about visitors leaving comments on the site, such as their IP address and browser type.
<br>It may be necessary for Gravatar to see if you are using it by creating an anonymous string from your email address (also known as a hash). If your comment is approved, your profile picture is displayed in the context of your comment.
<br>Publications
<br>Uploading images to the website should not include any embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Images on the website can be downloaded and extracted to obtain any location data.
<br>Contact forms
<br>Cookies
<br>Leaving a comment on our site gives you the option of saving your name, email address, and website in a cookie. You don't need to reenter your information each time you leave a comment with these for your convenience. It will take one year for these cookies to expire.
<br>To determine if your browser accepts cookies, we set a temporary cookie on our login page. You will be able to delete this cookie after closing your browser.
<br>Upon logging in, several cookies will be set up to save your login information and your screen layout preferences. Cookie durations for login and screen options are two days and one year, respectively. Your login will remain active for two weeks if you choose "Remember Me.". Once you log out, the cookies associated with your login will be removed.
<br>The extra cookie will be stored in your browser if a page is edited or published. No personal information is included in this cookie; it simply indicates the post ID for the article you just edited. One day after it is created, it expires.
<br>Websites that embed content from other websites
<br>Embedded content may appear on this site (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). When a visitor views embedded content from another website, it behaves exactly as if they had visited that website.
<br>If you have an account and are logged into the website, it may also collect data about you, use cookies, and embed additional third-party tracking to monitor your interaction with that embedded content.
<br>Analyses
<br>Our data sharing partners
<br>Keeping your data for how long
<br>Comments and their metadata are retained indefinitely if you leave a comment. As a result, any follow-up comments will be immediately recognized and approved rather than held in a moderation queue.
<br>Additionally, we store the personal information our users provide in our user profile (if any) if they register on our website. User information can be viewed, edited, or deleted at any time (except their username cannot be changed). This information can also be viewed and edited by website administrators.
<br>Your rights regarding your data
<br>The data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us, can be viewed by requesting an exported file by logging into your account on this site, or leaving a comment. Any data that we hold about you can also be erased at your request. This does not include any data required by law, administration, or security.
<br>Information we send to third parties
<br>Depending on the service, comments from visitors may be checked for spam.
